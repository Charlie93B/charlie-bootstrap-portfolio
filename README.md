# Charlie Bootstrap Portfolio


## Welcome to my Bootstrap Portfolio

This site demonstrates common skills used in front-end development with Bootstrap and provides links  
to the projects I am currently working on.

The site makes use of the Bootstrap classes and layouts to create a responsive website  
without the need for additional media queries.
